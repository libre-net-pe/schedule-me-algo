/**
 * Encoder/decoder for converting between genetic algorithm representations and schedule assignments.
 * 
 * The Codec class serves as a bridge between the genetic algorithm's numeric chromosome
 * representation and the actual schedule domain objects (TimeSlots and Offerings).
 * It handles the mapping between gene values (integers) and meaningful schedule assignments.
 * 
 * The encoding scheme works as follows:
 * - Each gene in a chromosome is an integer index
 * - The index maps to a unique (TimeSlot, Offering) combination
 * - The mapping is deterministic: same index always produces same assignment
 * - Total search space = number of time slots Ã— number of offerings
 * 
 * Time slots are automatically sorted by day (Monday first) and then by start time
 * to ensure consistent ordering across genetic operations.
